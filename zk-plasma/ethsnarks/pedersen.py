"""
This module implements a Pedersen hash function.
It can hash points, scalar values or blocks of message data.

It is possible to create two variants, however only the
non-homomorphic variant has been implemented.

The homomorphic variant users the same base point for every
input, whereas the non-homomorphic version uses a different
base point for every input.

For example to non-homomorphically hash the two points P1 and P2

	Four base points are chosen (consistently)

		B0, B1, B2, B3

	The result of the hash is the point:

		B0*P1.x + B1*P1.y + B2*P2.x + B3*P2.y

To homomorphically hash the two points:

	Two base points are chosen

		BX, BY

	The result of the hash is the point:

		BX*P1.x + BY*P1.y + BX*P2.x + BY*P2.y

	The hash will be the same if either point is swapped
	with the other, e.g. H(P1,P2) is the same as H(P2,P1).

	This provides a basis for 'chemeleon hashes', or where
	malleability is a feature rather than a defect.
